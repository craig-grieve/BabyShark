This Script is designed to download the list of twitter followers, the users who retweeted a specific tweet and the users on telegram.

Each section will create a csv with the final list at run time.

You will need a Telegram and Twitter API key to use this.

Note: As twitter rate limits the calls this will take some time to run for large twitter followings
